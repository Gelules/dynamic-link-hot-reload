This is a simple demo of a hot-swappable library.

It uses the dynamic linking library.

Demo:
'make' to compile the binary and the library
'make reload' to switch the library with another code

While executing the binary:
'print' to print what the library has to print
'exit' to exit the process
'reload' to reload the new library, do it after 'make reload'

Et voil√†, you've just loaded a brand new library without exiting your process.

This is a simple demo, but I may update it in the future just for fun and
non-profit. I'm thinking about linked lists to make it more generic and
scalable.
